        {
            "question": "Which of the following is used to print a message in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "print",
            "correct_answer": "print",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "In Python, the 'print()' function is the standard way to output text or variables to the console. Unlike other programming languages that use 'echo' (PHP), 'printf' (C), or 'cout' (C++), Python uses the simple and straightforward 'print' function."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the output of the expression `5 + 3 * 2` in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "11",
            "correct_answer": "11",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "Python follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS). In this expression, multiplication (3 * 2 = 6) is performed before addition (5 + 6 = 11). The result is 11 because Python respects mathematical precedence rules."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which data type is used to store a sequence of characters in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "str",
            "correct_answer": "str",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "In Python, the 'str' (string) data type is used to store text or sequences of characters. Strings can be created using single quotes ('') or double quotes (\"\") and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you start a for loop in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "for i in range(10):",
            "correct_answer": "for i in range(10):",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "Python's for loop syntax uses the 'for' keyword followed by a variable name, the 'in' keyword, and an iterable (like range()). The 'for i in range(10):' syntax is the correct way to create a loop that iterates 10 times in Python."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does `len()` function do in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "Returns the length of a list, string, or tuple",
            "correct_answer": "Returns the length of a list, string, or tuple",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The len() function in Python returns the number of items in an object. It can be used with various sequence types like strings (number of characters), lists (number of elements), tuples, or dictionaries (number of key-value pairs)."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which keyword is used to define a function in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "def",
            "correct_answer": "def",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. While 'lambda' is used for creating small anonymous functions, 'def' is the standard way to define regular functions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a correct way to write a comment in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "# This is a comment",
            "correct_answer": "# This is a comment",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "Python uses the hash symbol (#) for single-line comments. Unlike other languages that use // or /* */, Python keeps it simple with just #. Everything after # on the same line is treated as a comment and ignored by the interpreter."
        },
        {
            "question": "What will be the output of `type(42)` in Python?",
            "selected_answer": "<class 'int'>",
            "correct_answer": "<class 'int'>",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The type() function returns the data type of an object. Since 42 is an integer, type(42) returns '<class 'int'>'. This is Python's way of indicating that the number 42 belongs to the integer class."

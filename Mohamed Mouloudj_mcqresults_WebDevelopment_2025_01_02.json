        {
            "question": "Which CSS property is used to change the text color of an element?",
            "selected_answer": "color",
            "correct_answer": "color",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'color' property is used to set the color of text content. While 'font-color' and 'text-color' might seem intuitive, they are not valid CSS properties. 'background-color' affects the element's background, not the text color."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the 'z-index' property control?",
            "selected_answer": "The stack order of elements",
            "correct_answer": "The stack order of elements",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'z-index' property controls how elements stack on top of each other in the third dimension (z-axis). Higher z-index values appear on top of elements with lower values. This only works on positioned elements (position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the default value of the `position` property in CSS?",
            "selected_answer": "static",
            "correct_answer": "static",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The default position value is 'static', meaning the element follows the normal document flow. Static elements are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties, and z-index doesn't apply to them."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which CSS property controls the space between the content and the border of an element?",
            "selected_answer": "padding",
            "correct_answer": "padding",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "Padding controls the space between an element's content and its border. Margin controls space outside the border, border-spacing is for table cells, and box-sizing determines how dimensions are calculated."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which selector targets all `<p>` elements within a container with the class `box`?",
            "selected_answer": ".box p",
            "correct_answer": ".box p",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The selector '.box p' targets all paragraph elements that are descendants of any element with the class 'box'. This is called a descendant selector. 'p.box' would select paragraphs that have the class 'box', which is different."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you apply styles to an element with the class `highlight`?",
            "selected_answer": ".highlight",
            "correct_answer": ".highlight",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "To target elements by class, use a dot (.) followed by the class name. '#' is for IDs, just the name would target an element of that name, and '*' is the universal selector. Multiple elements can share the same class."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is the correct syntax for a CSS comment?",
            "selected_answer": "/* This is a comment */",
            "correct_answer": "/* This is a comment */",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "CSS comments use /* */ syntax. // is used in JavaScript, <!-- --> is for HTML comments, and # is not valid for CSS comments. CSS comments can span multiple lines between the opening /* and closing */."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which CSS property is used to set the font size of an element?",
            "selected_answer": "font-size",
            "correct_answer": "font-size",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'font-size' property controls text size. 'font-style' is for italic/normal text, 'font-weight' controls boldness, and 'text-size' is not a valid CSS property. Font size can be specified in various units like px, em, rem, or percentage."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the `float` property do in CSS?",
            "selected_answer": "It wraps text around an element",
            "correct_answer": "It aligns an element to the right or left of its container",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "The float property pushes an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to wrap around it. While it can be used for layout, modern alternatives like Flexbox and Grid are often better choices for complex layouts."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the `display` property of `inline-block` do?",
            "selected_answer": "Makes the element behave like an inline element",
            "correct_answer": "Allows elements to line up next to each other",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "inline-block combines features of both inline and block elements. It allows elements to sit next to each other (like inline) while maintaining block properties like respecting width/height and having margins/padding on all sides."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which CSS property is used to control the text alignment?",
            "selected_answer": "text-align",
            "correct_answer": "text-align",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'text-align' property controls horizontal text alignment within an element. It can be set to values like left, right, center, or justify. 'align-content' is for flexbox/grid, and the others are not valid CSS properties."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which CSS property is used to change the font style of text?",
            "selected_answer": "font-style",
            "correct_answer": "font-style",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'font-style' property is used to make text italic or normal. 'font-weight' controls boldness, 'font-family' sets the typeface, and 'text-style' is not a valid CSS property. Common values are normal, italic, and oblique."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which property is used to set the space between lines of text?",
            "selected_answer": "line-height",
            "correct_answer": "line-height",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "The 'line-height' property controls the vertical space between lines of text. It can be set as a number (multiplier), length, or percentage. 'letter-spacing' controls space between characters, and the others are not valid CSS properties."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the `clear` property do in CSS?",
            "selected_answer": "Clears the content of an element",
            "correct_answer": "Clears the float property",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "The 'clear' property prevents elements from floating beside cleared elements on the specified side (left, right, or both). It's commonly used to prevent elements from wrapping around floated elements and to clear float containers."

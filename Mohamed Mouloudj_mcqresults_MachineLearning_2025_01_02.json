        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a common unsupervised learning algorithm?",
            "selected_answer": "Logistic regression",
            "correct_answer": "K-means clustering",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "K-means clustering is a classic unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together without requiring labeled data. Support Vector Machines, linear regression, and logistic regression are all supervised learning algorithms that require labeled training data to learn from."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of K-means clustering?",
            "selected_answer": "To group data points into clusters based on similarity",
            "correct_answer": "To group data points into clusters based on similarity",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "K-means clustering aims to group similar data points into clusters by minimizing the distance between points within each cluster. It's particularly useful for discovering natural groupings in data without predefined labels. The algorithm iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster center and updates these centers based on the assigned points."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does PCA (Principal Component Analysis) do in machine learning?",
            "selected_answer": "It normalizes the data for better performance.",
            "correct_answer": "It reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving most of the variance.",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while retaining as much variance (information) as possible. It works by finding the principal components - directions in the data that capture the most variation. This is useful for visualization, reducing computational complexity, and handling the curse of dimensionality."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a key challenge in unsupervised learning?",
            "selected_answer": "Determining the number of clusters in K-means",
            "correct_answer": "Determining the number of clusters in K-means",
            "is_correct": true,
            "explanation": "Determining the optimal number of clusters (k) in K-means clustering is a significant challenge because there's no ground truth to compare against. This is known as the 'elbow problem' and often requires techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to make an informed decision. Unlike supervised learning, there are no true labels to validate against."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a dimensionality reduction technique?",
            "selected_answer": "Support Vector Machines",
            "correct_answer": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving maximum variance. Random Forests are for classification/regression, K-means is for clustering, and SVMs are for classification. PCA is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data and reducing computational complexity."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does hierarchical clustering produce?",
            "selected_answer": "A feature importance ranking",
            "correct_answer": "A set of clusters based on the distance between points",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "Hierarchical clustering produces a tree-like structure (dendrogram) showing how data points can be grouped at different levels of granularity based on their distances from each other. Unlike K-means, which produces a flat clustering, hierarchical clustering shows the relationships between clusters at different scales, allowing for more flexible cluster analysis."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is true about unsupervised learning algorithms?",
            "selected_answer": "They are less computationally intensive than supervised learning.",
            "correct_answer": "They can work with unlabeled data and find patterns on their own.",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "Unsupervised learning algorithms can discover patterns and structures in data without requiring labeled examples. This makes them particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and finding hidden patterns in data. Unlike supervised learning, which needs paired input-output examples, unsupervised learning can work with raw, unlabeled data."
        },
        {
            "question": "In unsupervised learning, how is performance typically evaluated?",
            "selected_answer": "By minimizing the loss function",
            "correct_answer": "By visualizing clusters or principal components",
            "is_correct": false,
            "explanation": "Since unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, traditional metrics like accuracy aren't applicable. Instead, evaluation often relies on visualization techniques and internal metrics like silhouette scores or explained variance ratio. Visualizing clusters or reduced dimensions helps assess if the algorithm has found meaningful patterns in the data."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It's a fundamental security tool that helps protect against unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats."

                "explanation": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is specifically designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and policy violations. It analyzes patterns of traffic and alerts administrators when potential security breaches are detected. Unlike encryption or load balancing, IDS is focused on identifying and reporting security incidents."

                "explanation": "A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server, allowing secure communication over public networks like the internet. This encryption ensures that sensitive data remains private and protected from interception, making it especially useful when using public Wi-Fi or accessing corporate networks remotely."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "A Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This can be used to steal sensitive information or manipulate the conversation without either party's knowledge."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "A Denial of Service attack works by overwhelming a system, network, or service with excessive traffic or requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This can be achieved through various methods, such as flooding servers with traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities that cause systems to crash."

                "explanation": "Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or login credentials. These attacks often use fake emails, websites, or messages that appear to be from trusted sources."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds additional layers of security beyond just a password by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. These factors typically include something you know (password), something you have (phone), and something you are (biometric)."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It's widely used due to its security and efficiency, making it the global standard for data encryption. Unlike RSA and ECC, which are asymmetric algorithms, AES processes data more quickly and is ideal for encrypting large amounts of data."

                "explanation": "Digital signatures provide authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity verification of digital messages or documents. They use public key cryptography to create a unique mathematical scheme that validates the authenticity of the sender and ensures the message hasn't been altered during transmission."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This system allows secure communication without sharing secret keys and is fundamental to many secure communications protocols on the internet."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Asymmetric encryption uses two mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This separation of keys enables secure communication without requiring a pre-shared secret key, making it ideal for initial key exchange and digital signatures, although it is generally slower than symmetric encryption."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size (128-bit) hash value. While no longer considered cryptographically secure, it demonstrates the key properties of hash functions: it's deterministic, quick to compute, and produces a fixed-size output regardless of input size. Unlike encryption algorithms, hash functions are one-way functions and cannot be reversed."

                "correctAnswer": 2,
                "explanation": "PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is specifically designed for securing email communications through encryption and digital signatures. It uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption to provide confidentiality, authentication, and integrity for email messages. Unlike SSL/TLS which secure the transmission channel, PGP secures the actual message content."

This is a fundamental property of hash functions, along with being deterministic and practically impossible to reverse. This makes them ideal for password storage, file integrity verification, and digital signatures."

                "explanation": "Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms that learn from labeled training data. K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models are unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering, while PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making them versatile supervised learning tools."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too precisely, including its noise and outliers. This results in excellent performance on training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data. It's like memorizing exam answers without understanding the underlying concepts - you'll do well on that exact exam but poorly on different questions testing the same material."

                "explanation": "House price prediction is a regression problem because it involves predicting a continuous numerical value. The other options are classification problems as they involve categorizing into discrete classes (spam/not spam, dog breeds, click/no click). Regression problems predict quantities that can take any value within a range."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This technique provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data and helps identify if the model is overfitting to the training data. Increasing complexity often leads to more overfitting, while using a smaller dataset or ignoring feature scaling typically degrades model performance."

                "explanation": "A validation set is used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data during the training process. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and detecting overfitting without contaminating the test set. Think of it as a practice exam before the final test - it helps you assess and adjust your performance before the final evaluation."

                "explanation": "A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of a classification model's performance by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This comprehensive view helps in understanding not just how many predictions were correct, but also the types of errors the model is making, which is crucial for many applications like medical diagnosis where different types of errors have different costs."

                "explanation": "Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary classification tasks, despite its name containing 'regression'. It outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, making it ideal for classification. K-means is for clustering (unsupervised learning), linear regression is for predicting continuous values, and PCA is for dimensionality reduction."

                "explanation": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the cost function. It works by calculating the gradient (direction of steepest increase) of the cost function and moving in the opposite direction. This is like finding the bottom of a valley by taking steps in the direction where the ground slopes downward."

                "explanation": "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used for evaluating regression models because it measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Accuracy, precision, and F1-score are metrics for classification problems. MSE is particularly useful as it penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring operation."

                "explanation": "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while retaining as much variance (information) as possible. It works by finding the principal components - directions in the data that capture the most variation. This is useful for visualization, reducing computational complexity, and handling the curse of dimensionality."

                "explanation": "A confusion matrix provides a complete picture of a classification model's performance by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From this matrix, multiple metrics can be derived, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comprehensive view helps understand where the model is making mistakes."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "Regularization adds a penalty term to the model's objective function to prevent overfitting by discouraging complex models. It's like Occam's razor - preferring simpler solutions when they explain the data equally well. Common techniques include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which penalize large parameter values."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "Max depth controls how deep a decision tree can grow. Limiting the depth prevents the tree from becoming too complex and memorizing the training data (overfitting). A deeper tree can capture more complex patterns but risks overfitting, while a shallower tree might generalize better but could underfit if too shallow."

                "explanation": "F1-score is a classification metric that combines precision and recall into a single score. It's particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes as it provides a balanced measure of both false positives and false negatives. MSE and R-squared are regression metrics, while AUC is another classification metric."

                "correctAnswer": 1,
                "explanation": "Using too many features can lead to overfitting, where the model learns noise in the training data rather than true patterns. This is known as the curse of dimensionality - as the number of features increases, the amount of data needed to make reliable predictions grows exponentially. The model might perform well on training data but poorly on new data."

                "explanation": "Learning curves show how model performance changes as the amount of training data increases. They help identify if adding more training data would improve model performance or if the model has reached its learning capacity. They can also help diagnose overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias) problems."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions in classification problems. While simple to understand, it should be used carefully with imbalanced datasets where other metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score might be more appropriate. MAE, R-squared, and RMSE are regression metrics that measure the difference between predicted and actual continuous values."

                "correctAnswer": 0,
                "explanation": "The bias-variance tradeoff represents the tension between a model's ability to minimize bias (capture underlying patterns) and variance (avoid fitting to noise). High bias leads to underfitting (too simple), while high variance leads to overfitting (too complex). Finding the right balance is crucial for good generalization."

                "explanation": "Early stopping monitors model performance on a validation set during training and stops when performance starts to degrade, preventing overfitting. It's like knowing when to stop studying - there's a point where additional studying (training) doesn't improve test performance and might actually make it worse. Momentum and batch normalization are optimization techniques, while weight decay is a form of regularization."

                "explanation": "The validation set provides an unbiased evaluation of model performance during training and helps in hyperparameter tuning. It's separate from both the training set (used for model fitting) and test set (used for final evaluation). Think of it as a mock exam before the final test - it helps assess performance without revealing the actual test questions."

                "explanation": "High variance typically occurs when a model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data. Such models tend to learn noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. It's like memorizing specific exam questions instead of understanding the underlying concepts - the model performs well on seen data but poorly on new examples."

                "explanation": "Log loss (logarithmic loss) measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability value between 0 and 1. It heavily penalizes predictions that are both confident and wrong, making it particularly useful when probabilistic predictions are important. Unlike accuracy, precision, or recall, log loss takes into account the uncertainty of predictions."
